# Progress dashboard

Snapshot date: 2026-11-01.
Last code checkpoint: `f3b1af6` (2026-11-01).
This table describes the 40 tasks in `MASTER_ROADMAP.md` — not the whole
repository and not a percentage of "the simulator being finished". Many tasks are
small slices; a low percentage here means "little of *this realism programme* is
evidenced", not "the simulator does not work".

## Task counts

## Critical unresolved defects

Ordered by visible impact, not by ease.

| # | defect | task | state | evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Rectangular tone blocks at 300–1,200 km | TD-05 | **VERIFIED** | per-vertex roughness removed the land term; the seam that motivated it now measures −0.04/255 against its own trend (was +4.14), frame-wide median +0.25/255 at 300 km and +0.47/255 at 1,200 km, inside ±1/255. The ocean half was measured with six new water views and **refuted** (no term carries a patch signal, p ≥ 0.12) |
| 2 | Synthetic detail fabricates lakes on the coastal plain | TD-06 | BLOCKED | visible in `terrain-600m`; guard implemented but inert |
| 3 | Land reads nearly black at 400 km while the deck is white | AT-03 | **VERIFIED — explained** | the altitude term is right: at `-4.0,138.0` the same ground measures the same albedo at 400 km and 3 km (0.0169 linear p50), occlusion is exactly 1.000, and the production/albedo ratio matches 300 km (1.77 vs 2.07). Tropical-forest albedo really is ~4 %; the deck is white because it is white. The *near-ground* render was 2.2× brighter because the local surface map carried absolute albedo 4× the overview's. **Fixed by TM-04**: it is now a tint anchored to the overview, so a descent moves the tone +2 % instead of +128 % |
| 4 | Cloud edges are salt-and-pepper cut-outs; one shape per regime | CL-05/06 | PLANNED | `1200km-90f` |
| 5 | Vegetation is sparse and reads as specks | VG-01/02 | PLANNED | `terrain-600m` |
| 6 | Regional imagery inset still steps at its patch edge | TD-04 | **VERIFIED** | the edge is now a 16.6 km cross-fade at the region bound: the frame's worst step within ±40 px of the bound fell from 4.23 to 0.72/255 (its own texture level), and the before/after change is confined to x=381..737, the declared band. Resolution now uses patch overlap, so a straddling patch binds the tile |
| 7 | Distant terrain has no geometric detail beyond LOD 11 | TM-02 | PLANNED | `300km-papua` |
| 8 | Windowed presentation fails on this machine | env | external | one present, then swapchain lost |

| visual capture path | works offscreen; windowed blocked | `d89e7d6` |
| diagnostic capture matrix | 18 terrain frames at 300 km, 18 at 1,200 km, 7 at 3–70 km; the post-fix roughness/production pair; 9 water-view frames; 2 paired pre/post crops | `903d7c8` |
| seam harness | `scripts/measure_patch_seam.py` reproduces the pre-fix seam at +4.14/255 and the post-fix seam at −0.04/255 | `903d7c8` |
| region-edge harness | `scripts/imagery_region_mask.py` + `scripts/measure_tone_edge.py` report the imagery edge at 4.23/255 before and 0.72/255 after, and the change confined to 16.4 km | 81f3c04 |
| TD-05 attribution A/B | constant-roughness and morph-off frames, same pose/clock/frames | `ec97d6e` |
| near-ground tone control | replacing the local albedo mix with the base (same normals, roughness, layers) drops the 3 km ratio from 4.36 to 1.98; the tint build measures 2.01 against 2.03 at 40 km | pending hash (TM-04) |

## Visual evidence coverage

| scene | state |
| --- | --- |
| prelaunch | partial (no HUD) |
| launch site | current |
| terrain close-up | current |
| coastline | **missing** |
| clouds | current |
| atmosphere / limb | **missing** |
| vegetation | partial |
| rocket ascent | **missing** |
| high altitude | current |
| orbit | **missing** |

Five of ten required scenes have no usable frame. See `VISUAL_EVIDENCE.md`.

## Performance baseline

| field | value |
| --- | --- |
| Current-commit measurement | **none** |
| Last CPU p50/p95/p99 (prelaunch, release, discrete GPU) | 16.66 / 17.63 / 19.04 ms (2026-09-11) |
| Last CPU p50/p95/p99 (ascent) | 13.53 / 25.28 / 27.36 ms (2026-09-11) |
| Worst frame | not recorded |
| GPU frame time | not exposed |
| Draw calls / triangles | not exposed |
| Memory | 1,261–1,492 MiB GPU; ~1.77 GB RSS (2026-09-11); 610–640 MB RSS (2026-08-23) |
| Terrain streaming | bounded at 128 MiB geometry budget; two worker bakes/frame (2026-09-11) |

The offscreen capture path is pinned to 60 Hz and is therefore **not** a
frame-pacing harness. See `PERFORMANCE_BASELINES.md`.

## OpenSpec status

| item | value |
| --- | --- |
| specs | 40 |
| active changes | 2 — `spaceflight-game-mvp` (5/37 tasks), `stabilize-far-field-tree-placement` (tasks complete, not archived) |
| archived changes | 29 |
| strict validation | 42/42 pass |
| requirement gaps | clouds have no OpenSpec spec (technical spec only); visual atmosphere beyond `atmosphere` is thin |

## Next task

**Next task — AT-02, the altitude transition and limb.** TM-04 is closed: the
near ground is anchored to the measured overview and a descent no longer brightens
the land (4.36 → 2.01 against 2.03 at 40 km). AT-02 is the next open atmosphere
task and the last one that needs frames rather than analysis: a continuous
ground → stratosphere → space sequence at 10, 30, 70 and 200 km plus a limb view,
checked against the exponential scale height. It is also the instrument the
remaining altitude questions need, because the residual 3 km vs 300–400 km
difference (2.01 vs 1.84) is air column, which is exactly what AT-02 must
characterise.
